# Jk-FF-Design-and-Verification
This repository contains the design and verification files for a JK Flip-Flop circuit. It includes Verilog/VHDL code for the JK flip-flop, along with testbenches and simulation scripts for verification. Ideal for freshers and students, this project provides a hands-on approach to learning digital design principles and sequential logic verification.
