# Jk-FF-Design-and-Verification
This repository contains the design and verification files for a JK Flip-Flop circuit. It includes Verilog/VHDL code for the JK flip-flop, along with testbenches and simulation scripts for verification. Ideal for freshers and students, this project provides a hands-on approach to learning digital design principles and sequential logic verification.

1. Overview
A JK flip-flop is a sequential logic circuit that has two inputs, J and K, and an output, Q. It operates based on the clock signal, toggling the output or setting/resetting it based on the state of J and K inputs at each clock edge. This README covers the design and verification of a JK flip-flop, including test coverage and assertions to verify correctness.

2. JK Flip-Flop Truth Table
J	K	Q (next state)
0	0	No change
0	1	Reset (Q = 0)
1	0	Set (Q = 1)
1	1	Toggle (Q changes state)

    
4. Design Description
The JK flip-flop is coded in Verilog, with two inputs, J and K, and an edge-triggered clock input. The output, Q, changes based on the state of J and K at the clock's rising edge.

5. Verification Strategy
The verification includes a testbench to simulate all possible input combinations of J, K, and clk, along with coverage collection and assertions to ensure correctness.

Verification Plan

Initialize: Start with Q = 0.
Apply all input combinations: Simulate each possible state of J and K at the clock edge:
J = 0, K = 0: Verify that Q does not change.
J = 0, K = 1: Verify that Q resets to 0.
J = 1, K = 0: Verify that Q sets to 1.
J = 1, K = 1: Verify that Q toggles on each clock edge.
Monitor and log outputs: Capture Q to confirm it matches the expected values for each combination.
Assertions: Add assertions to check that Q behaves correctly based on the input conditions.
Functional Coverage: Ensure all J, K states are covered.


5. Simulation and Results
Compile and run the design and testbench files in your simulator.
Observe the output: Check the assertions and coverage report.
Assertions help to verify the expected behavior at every clock cycle.
The coverage report will confirm that all states of J and K were exercised.
6. Debugging Tips
Check Assertion Failures: If an assertion fails, trace back to see which state combination caused it.
Inspect Coverage Report: Verify that all J, K combinations are covered. If not, modify the test sequence to ensure 100% functional coverage.
7. Conclusion
The JK flip-flop verification, with assertions and coverage, ensures a thorough check on the design. Assertions confirm correctness in real-time, while coverage metrics show that all input states have been tested.
